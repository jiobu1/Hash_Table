**Hashing Review**
- Deterministic
- Fast
- Sufficienty randomized 

**Collisions**

**Linked List Review**
- comprised of nodes
- value, next pointer, previous (if doubly linked-list)
- hashing, arrays, linked lists

**Collision Resolution Via Chaining**
evenly distribute values within table 
prevents colliding and overriding

now we store keys because we have to handle collisions

load factor = num elements/ num slots
* expand table if load factor > 0.7
* shrink if <
